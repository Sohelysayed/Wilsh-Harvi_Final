      <p>Bellroy sells thinner-than-typical wallets. There's value to that — but what is it, and how do you get the consumer to understand it?</p>

      <p> To answer those questions, Bellroy divided its product page into three stages of the buyer's journey — understanding the problem, how to fix the problem, and how Bellroy can resolve the problem.</p>

      <p>
      There's even an interactive section that shows how the skinny wallet will fill up in comparison to standard wallets. As users move a slider back and forth along a line, both of the wallets fill up with cards and cash, visually displaying the very problem Bellroy's skinny wallet solves.</p>

                  <p>The focus of Oreo's product page is how these simple, classic cookies can help people unleash their imaginations, dare to wonder, and become generally happier. It features a series of videos, one after another. One is accompanied by the lyrics, "It's so easy to let your imagination go when you play with Oreo," paying tribute to the age-old discussion about the "best" way to eat them. The page takes a creative, bold approach to marketing with what might otherwise be thought of as an ordinary snack.</p>

              <p>Volkswagen takes an interactive approach to its product marketing. Instead of listing all of the features you can have in a car, the company walks you through the process of actually building your car. As you go through that process, Volkswagen highlights the different features you could choose, then gives you a preview of what the car will look like and how that will affect the price.</p>

                     <p>Even though I'm not currently in the market for a new car, I personally had fun tinkering with the different customization features on the page. What color do I want? Do I want premium audio? (Yes.) It's an interesting way for the brand to eliminate the notorious connotations of "car salesmen," by allowing users to learn about and select features independently.</p>
